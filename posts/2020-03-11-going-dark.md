  Got rid of bootstrap and created my own design with CSS grid.

There is a new theme now for this blog which doesn't rely on bootstrap anymore.
I was in the mood to play with CSS Grid a little bit and I like how simple and
flexible it is.

Why did it become dark?  Here is an example of my experience with websites on
my mobile phone.  My phone switches to dark mode whenever
it's dark outside.  So at night, the display is very dark and not blinding me.
Whenever I open a website which is very bright, it really hurts my eyes.  So
for now I used a dark theme so this cannot happen. I plan to add a light mode
which has a great contrast so you can better read it when the sun is shining. 

The theme has some issues and I need to do some fine tuning.  Maybe it will
never work properly because I will most likely misuse it to test CSS stuff.
