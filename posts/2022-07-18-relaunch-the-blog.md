Since I never maintained rusty-blog and a lot of time passed, all dependencies
are outdated finally, the software just crashes when I try to run it.  That's
why I switched to cobalt for now to built pure static websites.

I want to rewrite rusty-blog in rocket because I think it is more stable than
actix-web.  At least it doesn't use unsafe operations.  The static aproach is
fine but I want more dynamic functionality like comments.

But maybe I should focus on the design first.  It really looks terrible!
