One of the first things I want to do when I start a blog is to clarify two
things:  The license and a privacy statement.

## License

The content of this blog is licensed under CC-BY-SA.  This means, the design
and the content can freely be copied, modified - even commercially.  The blog
software is dual licensed under Apache and MIT license.

## Privacy

This blog doesn't track anything.  No analytics software is used.  It
would be too depressing anyway :).
